<details>
<summary><strong> Click here to expand </summary></strong>

### üìñ Real-World Context:
A finance employee at a mid-sized company receives an email that appears to be from the payroll department. The email urges the recipient to click a link to avoid salary delays.
This is a classic phishing attempt aiming to steal login credentials or deliver malware.

<div align="center">
<img src =images/PhishingEmailDetected.png width="300" height="200>
</div>
 </br>

### üìß Sample Email:
- From: hr-support@payroll-verify-alert.com
- To: finance_dept@company.com
- Subject: Urgent: Action Required to Release Salary
- Body:

Your payroll verification is pending. Click the link to avoid salary delay:
http://payroll-verify-alert.com/login

### ‚ùå Red Flags:
- External spoofed domain
- Urgency (salary delay)
- Fake link
- Urgent language: ‚ÄúAction Required‚Äù
- External spoofed domain
- Misleading hyperlink
- Impersonation of internal dept.

### üß™ Analyst Action:
1. Create file `phishing_alert.log`
```
Timestamp | AlertType | Subject | Recipient | SenderFromAddress | ThreatType
2025-06-15 11:14:33 | ALERT | Urgent: Action Required to Release Salary | finance_dept@company.com | hr-support@payroll-verify-alert.com | URL Phishing
```

2. Upload to VM: `C:\SecurityLogs\phishing_alert.log`  
3. Create DCR using Sentinel > Data Connectors > Custom Logs  
4. Log Table: `PhishingLog_CL`

### üß† KQL Detection:
```kusto
PhishingLog_CL
| where AlertType == "ALERT"
| where Subject has_any("Urgent", "Action", "Suspension")
| extend DomainCheck = iif(SenderFromAddress endswith "@company.com", "Trusted", "Suspicious")
| project TimeGenerated=Timestamp, Recipient, SenderFromAddress, Subject, DomainCheck, ThreatType
```


### üß™ Dummy Logs (PhishingLog_CL)

| Timestamp           | AlertType | Subject                             | Recipient               | SenderFromAddress        |   DomainCheck |    | ThreatType 
|---------------------|-----------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------------------|----------------|-----------|
| 2025-06-15 11:14:33 | ALERT     | Urgent: Action Required to Release Salary | finance_dept@company.com | hr-support@payroll-verify-alert.com | @payroll-verify-alert.com  | URL Phishing   |



### üéØ MITRE ATT&CK Mapping
- [T1566.001 - Spearphishing via Service](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566/001/)
- [T1585.001 - Spoofing Email Accounts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1585/001/)

### üß† Alerting Process
- Microsoft Sentinel Incident Notification is triggered via custom analytic rule or connector (e.g., Defender for Office 365 or custom log ingestion).
- Alert appears in the Incidents pane within Sentinel, tagged under "Phishing" or "Email Spoof".
- Tier 1 SOC Analyst investigates sender domain, message headers, and hyperlinks.
- Analyst checks against internal allowlists and recent user reports.
- Teams or Email alert (if configured) notifies analyst or security team in real-time.

### üîê Prevention Techniques:
- Safe Links (Microsoft Defender)
Scans and rewrites URLs in emails; blocks known malicious links before click.

- Anti-Phishing Policies
Detects impersonation of VIPs or internal domains using behavioral analytics.

- SPF (Sender Policy Framework)
Verifies if sender IPs are authorized for the domain.

- DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail)
Adds a digital signature to ensure the message hasn‚Äôt been altered.

- DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting & Conformance)
Uses SPF and DKIM results to instruct receiving servers to reject/quarantine spoofed emails.


### üßØ Incident Response Steps
- Alert Detected in Microsoft Sentinel from Defender for Office 365, showing spoofed HR email with a suspicious link.
- Tier 1 Analyst investigates sender, confirms phishing, and checks if others received similar emails using KQL.
- Tier 2 Analyst quarantines the email, tests the malicious link in a sandbox, and blocks the sender domain and IOCs.
- Containment includes purging the email from all inboxes and applying transport rules to stop similar future attacks.
- Recovery & Awareness involves notifying users, resetting passwords (if clicked), and updating phishing training examples.
